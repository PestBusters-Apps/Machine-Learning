# Pestbusters 🌱🐛

**Pest Detection for Leafy Vegetables in Hydroponic Farming**

🚧 **This project is currently under construction.** 🚧  
We are actively working on building a robust solution for pest detection in hydroponic farming. Stay tuned for updates!

Pestbusters is a machine learning-based solution to detect pests in leafy vegetables, specifically designed to support hydroponic farming. By leveraging cutting-edge object detection models like YOLO and TFOD, Pestbusters empowers farmers and enthusiasts to maintain healthy crops and maximize yield.
